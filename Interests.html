      <p>I spend countless hours playing video games with my friends, and I don’t consider it a waste of time like most people. Video games provide us with a new world to hang out in, and we don’t even have to walk out of our front door. I play
        primarily on Xbox under the ailias TrinalFungus742, but I recently got a Nintedo Switch. The first game I got for it was Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it might be my new favorite game. You have an endless amount of things to
        discover, and you can only succeed by learning from your past mistakes. </p>

      <blockquote class="quote">“Obesity is one of the only problems that you can actually run from”-Anonymous</blockquote>
      <p>While it may not seem like it, my friends and I spend time together outside of video games, too. In fact, the majority of us are on the Licking Heights Cross Country team. I’ve also recently introduced them to <abbr class="abbr"
          title="Obstacle Course Races">OCRs</abbr> that I’ve been running for a few years and they seem to like it. I’ve ran races like the <cite>Savage Race</cite>, which is 6 miles long and has over 50 obstacles. I’ve also ran shorter, local races
        like the
        Dash for Donation. Running is something that I enjoy doing and it helps me stay in shape, so that’s a win-win for me.</p>
