      As you may have already figured out, my name is Derek Schindler. I was born on August 1, 2003, and I just turned 16. I live with my mom, Amy, my dad, Fred, and my little sister who acts like she’s 17, Ryann. I go to Licking Heights High School
      and I’m currently a sophomore, but I’m taking a few higher level classes. I’m in Honors Pre-Calculus, which is a senior level math class, and I’m taking AP Biology, which contains primarily juniors. I run on the Cross Country team, and while
      I’m nowhere near the best, it’s still enjoyable and one of my favorite sports that I’ve done throughout the years. Some of my favorite TV shows include Gravity Falls, The Amazing World of Gumball, and The Office, which is sadly being taken off
      of Netflix very soon.
