      As you may have already figured out, my name is Derek Schindler. I was born on August 1, 2003, and I just turned 16. I live with my mom, Amy, my dad, Fred, and my little sister who acts like she’s 17, Ryann. I go to Licking Heights High School
      and I’m currently a sophomore, but I’m taking a few higher level classes. I’m in Honors Pre-Calculus, which is a senior level math class, and I’m taking AP Biology, which contains primarily juniors. I run on the Cross Country team, and while
      I’m nowhere near the best, it’s still enjoyable and one of my favorite sports that I’ve done throughout the years. Some of my favorite TV shows include Gravity Falls, The Amazing World of Gumball, and The Office, which is sadly being taken off
      of Netflix very soon.

      <p>I live with my mom, my dad, and my little sister, and we have two cats and a bearded dragon. My grandparents on both sides of the family are from all over Europe, including (but not limited to) Germany, Austria, France, England, and possibly
        Ireland. Every December, my dad’s uncle throws a Christmas party where most, if not all of our extended family is invited. So, I know my dad’s cousins and aunts and uncles much better than my mom’s, whom I’ve never met, yet my mom will claim
        I have. As of right now, my mom's uncle recently passed away, and while I barely knew him, it's unsettling to see the rest of my family so upset.
